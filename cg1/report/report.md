### Subsubheading

This is a paragraph.
This is the same paragraph.

This is a new paragraph, with _italic_, **bold**, and `inline code` formatting.
It is possible to use special classes to format text: [this is a test]{.smallcaps}.

    i) The name of this phenomenon is tearing

    c)
    i) The reason that the depth buffer needs to be reset each frame is to
    ii)
    iii) Fragment/pixel shader, which is responsible for giving colors to each pixel. The second common shader is the vertex shader, which is responsible for determining positions of elements on the screen.
    iv) The index buffer is used to optimize how we draw shapes. We use triangles in graphics since it requires the least amounts of vertices to achive a plane with a normal,
    and lets say we want to draw a square: then we can use two of our previous vertices to draw it. we use bottom left and top right again, and only need to specify top left.
    Index buffer for this would be [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0]. we now need less vertices.
    v) We would pass in a non zero pointer when we want to start from an offset in our buffer. Perhaps our buffer contains other information prior to the vertex info.

Below is a figure (i.e. an image with a caption).
It floats and may as a result move to a different page depending on the layout.
