## Computer Graphics Assignment 1

2.  a)![](images/o2a.png)
    Exercise 2a
    i) The name of this phenomenon is clipping.
    ii) It occurs after the assembly and vertex shader(simple.vert in this case) stages. Happens when an object reaches outside the viewport.
    iii) The purpose of this is to discard/remove the primitives where vertices are outside bounds (normailized space viewing volume). The ones that are inside go through to the next stage in the pipeline. The viewport is 2x2x2 containing coordinates in [-1.0,1.0] for all 3 dimensions, and manually clamping the coordinates above or below the bounds made the shape now look like a triangle.

b) ![](images/o2b.png)
Exercise 2b
i) This phenomenon is also known as back face culling.
ii) It happens due to the direction the normal of the vertices are pointing to. Certain orderings of the index buffer makes opengl think it follows a clockwise order, thus the normal points away from the screen, and the triangle then disappears.
iii) The ordering of the index buffer, following the use of the right hand rule, needs to make the normal of e.g a triangle points outward toward the screen to avoid back face culling.

c)
Exercise 2c
i) The reason that the depth buffer needs to be reset each frame is to avoid comparing the new pixels with the depth values from last frame. You want to redraw everything, and thus reset depth buffer accordingly.
ii) If you have multiple overlapping shapes, you could use the fragment shader multiple times for the same pixel. 
iii) Fragment/pixel shader, which is responsible for giving colors to each pixel. The second common shader is the vertex shader, which is responsible for determining positions of elements on the screen. It basically transforms input data from original to display space.
iv) The index buffer is used to optimize how we draw shapes. We use triangles in graphics since it requires the least amounts of vertices to achieve a plane with a normal,and lets say we want to draw a square: then we can use two of our previous vertices to draw it. we use bottom left and top right again, and only need to specify top left.
Index buffer for this would be:

```rust
// Example of index buffer for a square, using only 4 vertices instead of 6.
let indexBuffer: Vec<f32> = vec![0,1,2,1,2,3];
```
This reduces space required masssiely, especially for more complex structures.

v) We would pass in a non zero pointer when we want to start from an offset in our buffer. Lets say we not only store vertex coordinates, (x,y,z) but also texture coordinates (u, v). since we use f32, the offset to the textures would be 3 * 4 (# of bytes). The value of this pointer should then be 12. We do not need this for now since we're only storing vertex coordinates.

Exercise 3 3. ![
    Colored Square using only 4 indices in the index buffer - 3e)
](images/o3square.png)
![
    Colored triangle which I'm reading in from a file - 3f)
](images/o3f.png)

Also have commented out how I used uniform variable to change the color of the drawn triangle(s)/square, but this isn't quite stable and crashes "randomly".
